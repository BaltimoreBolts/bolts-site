    "content": "<p><span>Welcome to the online home of the Baltimore Bolts, Baltimore City's own FIRST Robotics Competition team. We started in 2016 and are in our 3rd season. The team is open to participation for all high school students in Baltimore City Public Schools. Our meetings are held 300 West Pratt Street in downtown Baltimore. Our mission is to give our team members the inspiration and skills needed to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing through competitive robotics programming. Competitive robotics creates growth opportunities for students in the following ways:</span></p><ul><li><span>Students need to work as a team to brain storm, make decisions, correct mistakes, and complete tasks to field a competition ready robot</span></li><li><span>Students need to work around skill, knowledge and time limitations to complete their assigned tasks</span></li><li><span>Students need to define roles, define responsibility, and hold each other accountable to ensure the project is well managed</span></li><li><span>Students need to design, build, code, and test robots capable of competing in the given year&rsquo;s game</span></li><li><span>Students need to learn how to communicate, deal with failure and work through stress inducing situations to make sure the team is greater than the sum of its parts</span></li><li><span>Students need to compete head to head and along side students from a variety of schools, backgrounds, and skill levels to earn competition success</span></li><li><span>Students need to build a community coalition to increase the number of teams, increase the number and diversity of students involved and increase the community&rsquo;s support for competitive robotics</span></li></ul>"
